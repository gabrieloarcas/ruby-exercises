# Times Tables
# Create a program which outputs the 2 times table ( 1 x 2 = 2, 2 x 2 = 4, etc )
# Amend your program so that it asks for a number and outputs that table (e.g. 2, 3, etc)
# Amend your program so that if -1 is given above, it will output all tables from 1 to 12
# Have you repeated code within your program? Refactor your code to use methods to avoid this.
# Create a class which generates a Times Table and use this to produce the output
